# Hi, I'm Kmilo!

Welcome! I'm Kmilo, a software developer from Cuba, currently living in Spain. I'm passionate about technology and I love to learn new things. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a professional.

I love [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org). I started my career as a frontend engineer and I'm still in love with it. Currently I work as a full-stack developer at [Check24](https://www.check24.es/), a German company that offers a comparison platform for different services.
