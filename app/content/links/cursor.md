# How to setup Cursor IDE on Ubuntu 24.04?

Since Cursor IDE is not available on Ubuntu 24.04 via snap, we need to install it manually. The download link only offers a `.AppImage` file, so we need to make it executable and run it.

There is a bash script available on [Github](https://gist.github.com/jorcelinojunior/131748e12a039c02148a6f66e1fb312c) that helps with the installation.
