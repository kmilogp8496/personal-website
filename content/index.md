## About me:

I'm a software developer from Cuba, currently living in Spain. I study a master's degree about Internet of Things at the University Carlos III of Madrid. I'm passionate about technology and I love to learn new things. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a professional.

I love [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org). I started my career as a frontend engineer and I'm still in love with it. in the past few years I've also developed backend applications and I enjoy it too.

I'm a Linux user (Yes, I needed to say it, why not?) and I love open source software. I enjoy working with servers, but only as side projects. I'm not a sysadmin, but I like to learn about it.

I'm also a big follower of some of the Vue and Nuxt core team members. I love their work and I think they are a big source of inspiration for the community.
